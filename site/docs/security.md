## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities with critical impact should be reported on the [Security](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/security) page of this repository, which is a private way of communicating vulnerabilities to maintainers. This project is in maintenance-only mode and it can take a while until someone gets back to you.

If it is not a critical vulnerability, please open an issue and we will categorize it as a security issue. By giving visibility, we can get more help from the community at fixing such issues.

When reporting an issue, where possible, please provide at least:

* The commit version the issue was identified at
* A proof of concept (plaintext; no binaries)
* Steps to reproduce
* Your recommended remediation(s), if any.

The File Browser team is a volunteer-only effort, and may reach back out for clarification.
