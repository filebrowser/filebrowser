**Caddy-hugo fills the gap between Hugo and the browser.** [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) is an easy, blazing fast and awesome static website generator. This plugin fills the gap between Hugo and the end-user, providing you an web interface to manage the whole website.

*The following information is directed to developers. If you just want to use it, read the [documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/hugo) at Caddy website*.

## Build from source

**Requirements**

+ [Go 1.6 or higher][1]
+ [caddydev][2]
+ [go-bindata][3]
+ [Node.js w/ npm][4] (optional)


If you want to go deeper and make changes in front-end assets like JavaScript or CSS, you'll need to install the optional tools listed above.

**Get it and build**

1. Open the terminal.
2. Run ```go get github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo```.
3. Navigate to the clone path.
4. If you want to make changes in the front-end change the last comment in the beginning of ```hugo.go``` file to ```//go:generate go-bindata -debug -pkg assets -o assets/assets.go templates/ assets/css/ assets/js/ assets/fonts/```; execute ```npm install``` in the root of ```caddy-hugo``` clone. Then, run ```grunt watch```.
5. Run ```go generate```.
6. Open the folder with your static website and create a Caddyfile. Read the [docs](http://caddyserver.com/docs/hugo) for more information about the directives of this plugin.
7. Open the console in that folder and execute ```caddydev --source $PATH$ hugo```, replacing ```$PATH``` with the absolute path to your caddy-hugo's clone.
8. Open the browser and go to ```http://whateveryoururlis/admin``` to check it out.
