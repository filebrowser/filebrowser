# Features

# Installation

## One-step script

If you're running a Linux distribution or macOS, you can use our special script - made by [Kyle Frost](https://www.kylefrost.me/) - to download the latest version of File Browser and install it on `/usr/local/bin`.

```shell
curl -fsSL https://filebrowser.github.io/get.sh | bash
```

If you're on Windows, you can use PowerShell to install File Browser too. You should run the command as administrator because it needs perissions to add the executable to the PATH:

```shell
iwr -useb https://filebrowser.github.io/get.ps1 | iex
```
