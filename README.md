> ⚠️ WARN: **This is a small project with the objective of building an actual example of how to integrate bpmn-js in a Vue+GO solution. Vue-bpmn-browser is originally a fork of the excellent "filebrowser". The developers need your help to keep improving their product: please read [#532](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/issues/532) for more info!**

The original filebrowser solution is described as follow: "filebrowser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit your files. It allows the creation of multiple users and each user can have its own directory. It can be used as a standalone app or as a middleware."

vue-bpmn-browser is building on top of the existing solution by adding the bpmn.io diagrams viewer: simply open a .bpmn file to make the magic happen. No extensions are available at the moment but you can make use of any standard extra attribute, such as xmlns:bioc="http://bpmn.io/schema/bpmn/biocolor/1.0".

## Features
