    Here you can define a set of allow and disallow rules for this specific
    user. The blocked files won't show up in the listings and they wont be accessible
    to the user. We support regex and paths relative to the users scope.
  rulesHelp2: >
    Each rule goes in one different line and must start with the keyword
    {0} or {1}. Then you should write {2} if you are using a regular expression and
    then the expression or the path.
