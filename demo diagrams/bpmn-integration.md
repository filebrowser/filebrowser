Nowadays, business diagrams follow the universal BPMN standard.

The open-source solution bpmn-js from BPMN.io makes it very easy to view and build such diagrams.

This new filebrowser feature enables the integration with bpmn-js for viewing only.

## Features

Open any .bpmn file to view the diagram.

You can click and hold the mouse in order to move the diagram around.

You can also zoom with CTRL + Scroll!

## To do

Add bpmn-js extensions.
